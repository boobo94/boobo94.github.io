How I got my digital certificate from certSIGN and connected it with ANAF

Getting a digital certificate from Certsign and connecting it with ANAF was a challenging tasks I had to do. It took me almost a month, two trials, and a lot of patience to complete it. But I did it, and I want to share my experience with you.

The buying process with Certsign was decent, but they need to handle better the process of giving more information upfront. There were moments when I encountered errors that were only visible in the browser console. At the end, I had no idea if the process was finished successfully or not. I tried multiple times to start the online validation process, but after several trials, it worked and I got the token.

Then the fun started. It was like a carousel. I tried to connect my digital signature with ANAF. This time, the registration process was a mess, nothing was clear, the labels of input fields were undescriptive. I had to upload a confirmation PDF, signed with my new digital signature, this document signed by me and by Certsign. This was pretty easy and clear enough. Then I had to upload the documents that back me up as owner or administrator of my company. And here is the joy. I created a ZIP as they specified with a representative document. Surprise, the process was finished, I got 0 feedback, I had no clue if the process was finished or not. One day later, I discovered a post on Facebook with someone that mentioned it is needed to upload the ID of the administrator as well in the ZIP file. I tried to register again, adding the missing ID copy, but this time I got an error that I already registered before and to wait. It was clear enough now that my request arrived. After one week, I got the rejection, with the mention that I need to add a copy of my ID. I filled the form again with all the required data, this time, at the end of the form, I was welcomed with a success message (which means the first time was missing for no reason). I waited for one extra week. But yeah, this time I finally did it. After the congratulation email, I jumped right away in Oblio to connect the electronic signature with e-factura. And after almost one month, I'm done.

Why am I sharing this? Because I want to raise awareness about the difficulties and inefficiencies that many people face when trying to get a digital certificate and connect it with ANAF.

I think Certsign and ANAF should improve their user experience and provide more feedback and guidance to their customers. I also want to encourage others who are in the same situation to not give up and keep trying. It is possible to achieve your goal, even if it takes longer than expected.
