I recently tried out TikTok ads for the first time and I wanted to share some of my learnings and challenges with you. 

TikTok is a fast-growing platform with a huge and engaged audience, so I was curious to see how it would perform for my business. I created a custom audience based on my website visitors and set up a campaign with a video ad showcasing my product.

The process was pretty similar to other ads platforms, but I encountered some issues along the way. For example, I could not create a secondary ad group within the same campaign, even though the platform seems to have this feature. I think I have to publish the first ad group before I can create another one, which is a bit inconvenient.

Another problem I faced was that I had a second custom audience that was smaller than 1000 people, and TikTok did not allow me to use it, saying it was too small. This was frustrating, because I knew exactly who I wanted to target and I did not want to waste my budget on irrelevant users.

On the bright side, I found it interesting that I could target hashtags on TikTok, which is a unique feature that allows me to reach users who are interested in specific topics or trends. I think this could be a great way to increase brand awareness and engagement.

Today, I am going to publish my campaign and see how it performs. I am hoping to get some positive results and learn more about this exciting platform. If you have any feedback or suggestions for me, please let me know in the comments.


## TikTok Ads vs. Facebook Ads

After experimenting with both TikTok and Facebook ads for my ridesharing üöó business, I've learned some valuable lessons that I'd like to share with you.

1Ô∏è‚É£ TikTok ads allow you to create multiple ad groups, but you must publish at least one ad in the campaign to do so.

2Ô∏è‚É£ TikTok ads don't let you target specific hashtags, which can make it difficult to reach your desired audience. While you can use some hashtags, finding others with over 1M views can be challenging.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The cost-per-click (CPC) for your own custom audience on TikTok is 10x more expensive than the audience created by TikTok.

4Ô∏è‚É£ After one day of running ads, Facebook performed better than TikTok ads for my niche in ridesharing.

What have you learned from your own advertising experiments?
