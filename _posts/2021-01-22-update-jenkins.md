Hi dears, I hope you’re happy to come here, because I’ll show you the easiest way to update Jenkins. Not all of us are Devops daily, but sometimes we face this situation so show the next two commands and have fun:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade 
```

I hope this article was helpful. If you consider it useful, please give it a share.
