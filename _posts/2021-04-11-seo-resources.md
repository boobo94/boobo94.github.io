## 1. <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/keyword-traffic-estimation/" target="_blank">Here’s why you can’t blindly trust keyword search volume for traffic estimations</a>

The practical application of the keyword search volume metric is quite obvious. We use it to determine how much organic search traffic our page will get if it ranks on the front page of Google for a given keyword. 

## 2. <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/best-keyword-research-tools/" target="_blank">6 Best Keyword Research Tools for SEO</a>

## 3. <a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-officially-throttling-keyword-planner-data-low-spending-adwords-accounts-255795" target="_blank">Google officially throttling Keyword Planner data for low spending AdWords accounts</a>

According to Google, “most” advertisers will see Keyword Planner data as usual. But AdWords users with a “lower monthly spend” could see limited data in the planner. How limited? Very. The ranges that Google will provide for those with small (or no) spends makes the tool almost useless.

## 5. <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/what-are-backlinks/" target="_blank">What is a Backlink? How to Get More Backlinks</a>

Backlinks are links from a page on one website to another. If someone links to your site, then you have a backlink from them. If you link to another website, then they have a backlink from you.

## 6. <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/long-tail-keywords/" target="_blank">What Are Long-tail Keywords? How to Find and Use Them</a>

Long-tail keywords are terms with low search volumes. Despite what many people think, it has nothing to do with how long or short a keyword is, how well it’s likely to convert, or how specific it is.

## 7. <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/keyword-difficulty/" target="_blank">Keyword Difficulty: How to Determine Your Chances of Ranking in Google</a>

Finding a bunch of keywords that you want to rank for is easy. The hard part is figuring out what it’ll take to rank for those keywords (i.e., “keyword difficulty”), and then using that information to prioritize and plan your SEO strategy.
