Startup graveyard is a series of killed projects that made millions in revenue per year

Just watch their graveyard and do it your own. What better validation do you expect.

I was reading a [post on IH](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/indie-hacker-opportunities-in-googles-graveyard-3af4fcb8f7) about this subject and it looks so inspirational to me. That's why I decided to go deeper and share this.

Isn't insane that they kill a valuable project? I mean producing millions is something. That is true, they pump some money to arrive at that stage, but still.

You're not Google, building a pre-validated product, which already had customers can be something and can change your life for sure. I must admit, I want such a product and such a market and such a revenue.

Is anyone already did this? Who tried to replicate the buried project of Google and work on it.

## Where you can find these projects?

1. [Startup Cemetery](https://www.failory.com/cemetery)
2. [Google Cemetery](https://killedbygoogle.com)
3. [Amazon Cemetery](https://www.failory.com/amazon)

I'll go deeper into this subject and try to find something interesting. What about you?! Did you find something relevant?
