Google kills projects that made millions in revenue per year

Just watch their graveyard and do it your own. What better validation do you expect.

I was reading a [post on HN](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/indie-hacker-opportunities-in-googles-graveyard-3af4fcb8f7) about this subject and it looks so inspirational to me. That's why I decided to go deeper and share this.

Isn't insane that they kill a valuable project? I mean producing millions is something. That is true, they pump some money to arrive in that stage, but still.

You're not Google, building a pre-validated product, which already had customers can be something and can change your life for sure. I must admit, I want such a product and such a market and such a revenue.

Is anyone who already did this? Who tried to replicate the buried project of Google and work on it.

Where you can find these projects?

I'll go deeper into this subject and try to find something interesting. What about you?! Did you found something relevant, please tell me.
