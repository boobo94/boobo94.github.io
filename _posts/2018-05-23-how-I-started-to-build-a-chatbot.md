# So let's begin

I'm not here to say how brave I am. or something else, but trying to listen to a good guy on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFh7FvnJ_0sVP4V0rZe6AaA) and thinking on my dissertation which comes soon and to the fact that I need to choose a subject for my final project, having the shower on top of me I got this briliant idea. So yea I say let's build something to help people and John was talking about some guys which are in college and wants to learn programming and I remember how hard was for me to find informations from many and many places to put them together and in the end to have something real which can help people all over the world.

# The big idea

So I was there with the wather wetting my body and having the opportune time for relax, I tought ... let's build a chatbot for students, something which will listen to them and will reply to them about subject like 'How can I find my career', 'Where should I move after university?', 'What comes after highschool?', so in a more meaningful terms a chatbot which helps people to find their vocation and to answer to this kind of subject.

# The research

I finish my bath and I put my pants back in bed, so guess what.. I couldn't sleep, because I had a lot of great ideas and my mind was shotted with many and many things.

The second they I did a short research in the area and I discovers some great platforms that are already doing this like [wit.ai](http://wit.ai){:target="_blank"}, [api.ai](http://api.ai){:target="_blank"}, [IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/){:target="_blank"}, [Microsoft Luis](https://www.luis.ai/){:target="_blank"}, all these info can be found in details on [this article](https://medium.com/@abraham.kang/understanding-the-differences-between-alexa-api-ai-wit-ai-and-luis-cortana-2404ece0977c){:target="_blank"}

# End of first story
