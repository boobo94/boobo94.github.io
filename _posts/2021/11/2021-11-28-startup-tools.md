Are you looking for startup tools? Hi founder and nice to meet you. You can reply to me <a href="https://twitter.com/militaru_bogdan" target="_blank">@militaru_bogdan</a>.

Because I was and still I am in the position where I wanna try new tools and find the best for my startup. In this article I would like to share with you few that I found useful. Note that you should probably bookmark this post, because I continuously update it.

## Invoices
1. <a href="https://free-invoice.co.za/" target="_blank">Create and send professional looking invoices online.</a> from Free Invoice
2. <a href="https://zipbooks.com/" target="_blank">Simple accounting software that makes you even smarter.</a> from ZipBooks. Is the software that I currently use for my <a href="https://cmevo.com" target="_blank">software company</a> Cmevo Digital.
3. <a href="https://www.invoicesimple.com/invoice-generator" target="_blank">Invoice simple generator</a> helps you generate invoices very simple, without requiring an account.
4. <a href="https://frappebooks.com/" target="_blank">Frapebooks</a> - Simple, well designed, desktop accounting software for freelancers and small businesses. Free and Open Source. I really like the tool because is open source, built with Vuejs, Electron and Sqlite. But is not ready for Europe, because the invoice format is not at EU standard, the TAX number is named differently.

## Management

1. <a href="https://www.manager.io/" target="_blank">Manager.io</a> - Manager is free accounting software for small business. Available for Windows, Mac and Linux for free on desktop version. You can manage invoices, vendors, projects and all the financial system.
