When I started my journey as developer, I tried to figure it out a way of finding the best resources out there. How can I learn something new, without someone to teach me? Well, I can learn by myself, but for that I need materials.

That is exactly what I'm describing below. It is a list with links, articles and other resources only for you.

## Learn to code

- [Freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
I consider freecodecamp the most important resource in your beginning. You should give it a try, create an account an choose a course. Check their [blog](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/) too.

## What to listen to, when you code?

It depends by your vibe, but sometimes I listen Snoop Dog, Bug Mafia, etc. But mostly, if I need to concentrate I listen to some chill music.
