1/ Company Brand vs. Individual Brand

Large corporations tend to experience the most advantages as multiple brands work together to generate multiple revenue streams. 

Small businesses may not have the capital available to start multiple brands. 

2/ When the individual #brand structure is better? One of these should apply for products or services:

- serve different #audiences
- have separate #visions and #purposes
- each is strong enough to stand on its own without the endorsement of the parent #brand 

3/ A good example is #google which use the brand house: #GooglePlay, #GoogleDrive, etc. But with the time it starts to move the #products under #individualbrand for cars or others. They created #alphabet to remove the confusion with the brand.
