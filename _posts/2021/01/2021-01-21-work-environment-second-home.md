The work environment is your second home, or maybe even better is your first home. If you have a 9-5 job, probably you spend most of your day time inside your work environment. I assume that every one of us wants a clean, cozy and hospitable home. Exactly the same is with the work environment.

I know how important is a good work environment because that is what I learned from my previous job. When I wrote about this subject in [I’m back again in 2020 with a retrospective of 2019](https://boobo94.xyz/developer-story/retrospective-back-again-in-2020/) article. I felt the community don’t resonate with me and my values. That made me overthink and in the end to decide my exit. And this is not something bad. It is a good thing to leave because in that way you can learn more about work environments and about you.

In my conception, a good work environment is that environment that fits with your ideas and future plans. If you want to be lazy (don’t get me wrong, this is not necessarily something bad for someone who feels good with this, not everyone should change the world or build the next Microsoft, Apple or Tesla) you should find that mentality in the company that you work for. Unless if you are eager to learn more, to do more, to feel more and in the end to be the number one, then you should search for the right place.

The work environment is the most important asset of your employee’s life. In order for you to discover more about this subject, you must learn about your company. Don’t trust in every bullshit you get in the presentation interview. Because in most cases is just a nice packed shit, delivered directly under your nose. Read about them on social, search for sites like [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm), search on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bogdan-alexandru-militaru/) and other sources.

A great model of good practices, at least from my point of view, granted by my thoughts and aspirations are applied by Tesla. They listed some rules for employees, a simple handbook, [Tesla’s The Anti Handbook](https://www.scribd.com/document/446927426/Tesla-Anti-Handbook-Handbook#download). This handbook is exactly what I think myself and probably I’ll implement something similar for my agency [CMEVO](https://cmevo.com/). These days I read [5 Things I Learned From Tesla’s Anti-Handbook](https://dev.to/snj/5-things-i-learned-from-tesla-s-anti-handbook-57fo), by [Nick Mose](https://dev.to/snj) which share some opinions about this subject too.
