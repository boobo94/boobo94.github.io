## What is OWASP - Open Web Application Security Project


The Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide is a technology agnostic set of general software security coding practices, in a comprehensive checklist format, that can be integrated into the development lifecycle. [[1](#1)]

The focus is on secure coding requirements, rather then on vulnerabilities and exploits. It includes an introduction to Software Security Principles and a glossary of key terms. [[1](#1)]

It is designed to serve as a secure coding kick-start tool and easy reference, to help development teams quickly understand secure coding practices. [[1](#1)]

Quick guide reference can be downloaded from [here](https://www.owasp.org/images/0/08/OWASP_SCP_Quick_Reference_Guide_v2.pdf){:target="_blank"} [[2](#2)]
