Make a bootable usb with Windows or Linxu, from your macbook, that's sounds a little bit hard, but I know why you are here, so please continue to read. Few days ago, I encountered some troubles trying to make a bootable usb drive with Windows 10 from my macbook laptop. So I decided to make this post, to let you drink a coffee, instead of consuming time searching for help.

For me, two apps, worked very well and I like them very much, because are intuitive and easy to use. Both of them are compatible with Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Etcher

I really like this one because the interface it's clean and the design looks more adapted to these days.

## UNetbootin

The graphic interface it's not so clean, but you can make a real deal with this tool.
