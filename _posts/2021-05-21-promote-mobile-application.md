Everyone wants a mobile application lately and most of the time I donâ€™t know what it means to create a mobile application. The hardest part is definitely not finding a team of programmers to technically implement your vision. What is most difficult to achieve, in fact, is promoting the application.

During this article, we set out to approach a complete study on the subject. We have divided this article into two categories, depending on the financial investment: free and paid promotion. Obviously, nothing is free and each of them comes with a certain cost, but we made this division based on direct financial investment. Because we want to respond promptly to your requirements, we present the table of contents:
