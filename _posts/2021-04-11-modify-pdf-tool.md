Hei.. today I'll share with you a tool that helped me to modify text in PDF files, but it does more than that. 

In my tasks at <a href="https://cmevo.com">cmevo</a> I had to change some text in documents and I tried many tools online and offline, both. But the greatest tool that acomplished my needs is free - Inkscape.

> What is Inkscape?

> Inkscape is a Free and open source vector graphics editor for GNU/Linux, Windows and MacOS X. It offers a rich set of features and is widely used for both artistic and technical illustrations such as cartoons, clip art, logos, typography, diagramming and flowcharting. It uses vector graphics to allow for sharp printouts and renderings at unlimited resolution and is not bound to a fixed number of pixels like raster graphics. Inkscape uses the standardized SVG file format as its main format, which is supported by many other applications including web browsers.

The tool is very nice, simple but very powerfull. If you wanna try it link below, don't forget is free, but a donation will be much appreciated.
