Entrepreneurs are bad, entrepreneurs are evil, the boss is a bad guy, without me the business cannot be in the current spot. Do you know these statements? As an ex Soviet Union country, where the communism was very strong rooted in our culture I grew up with a poor mentality. 

Why!? Because after '89, in Romania the communism was destroyed and we saw the light of democracy. That came out with capitalism, so we were allowed to grow our own businesses. But we had no legislation, no idea how to do it, no examples. What we did?! Smuggling. It was so simple, buy from outside crappy things and sell it inside. And it worked for a lot of people.

This behavior turned out some entrepreneurs into scammers, who bought cheap and sell expensive, by exploating the other side of the coint, the people who has not so much luck or balls to start their own business. These peoples usually were exploited so the picture of entrepreneurs was outlined: entrepreneurs are bad, entrepreneurs are evil.
