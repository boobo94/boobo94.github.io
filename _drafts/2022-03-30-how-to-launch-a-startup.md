I tried to do it few times, but every time I felt like I'm not able to do it and probably never finish it. I learnt a lot from books or from online articles, but all the time the phrases were repeted over and over with the same content.

As all my blog posts, I'll be straight to the point, because this article is not only for you, but is for me too. Is a way of taking notes while I'm learning and in the moment I write these lines the learning process is still active.

So how to launch a startup, line by line.

## 1. Find your idea

Here's your magic on the way of launching a startup. The cliche "find problems around you and solve them", is somehow true, but sometimes there are a lot of problems that are not exactly around you. What helps me is to watch problems of my clients (I run a [software agency](https://cmevo.com)).

But REMEMBER, your idea don't have to be unique. Competition is good and it helps you

## 2. Validate idea

<!-- todo: ideas -->
- talk to people 100, 1000 people, 10 are not enough
- try to tell them what's the idea about
- tell them when the product can be ready and what's the price
- offer discount if they buy early (50-70% lifetime or it depends), if they ask about guarantee you can tell them is like a risk for a future investment, but offer them full refund if they're not satisfied with the final product after release.

## 3. Build the product or service

You're good now and probably know how to launch a startup. You have the idea, is validated and need to define the product or service, but still don't know what to build or what the product should contain initially or later.

Don'y worry, go after competition and see what they offer.

### 3.1. Analyze competition

How to launch a startup when you don't know what's the startup, right?! Check what others do and try to do best. But remember, some of their features are already validated by you or by them with a real audience, so you have to build them.

In order to analyze competition you can do it manually using search engines and type down advantages and disadvantages, but except this old fashion way, you should check their online presence and how to do this if now using [Tools for Analyzing Your Competition](https://whyboobo.com/startup/resources/tools-analyzing-competition/).
