I launched few projects, but every time I felt like I'm not able to do it and probably never finish it. I learnt a lot from books or from online articles, but all the time the phrases were repeted over and over with the same content.

As all my blog posts, I'll be straight to the point, because this article is not only for you, but is for me too. Is a way of taking notes while I'm learning and in the moment I write these lines the learning process is still active.

So how to launch a startup, line by line.

## Find your idea

![find your idea for startup](https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/02/13/08/54/brain-2062057_1280.jpg)

The cliche "find problems around you and solve them" is somehow true, but not all the times problems suround you. What helps me is to watch problems of my clients (I run a [software agency](https://cmevo.com)).

But REMEMBER, your idea don't have to be unique. Competition is good and it helps you to grow. I made this mistake with many ideas, thinking that I don't have any chance if my product is not unique. The product is not you, is not your software, it's about the team and the know how, more than everything.

By time to time I am curious what others wants to build and some of the websites that I check are these:

- <a href="(https://www.indiehackers.com/group/ideas-and-validation" target="_blank">Ideas and Validation Group from IH</a> 
- <a href="(https://needgap.com" target="_blank">needgap</a> 
- <a href="https://kern.al" target="_blank">Kern.al</a> 
- <a href="https://plygrnd.xyz" target="_blank">Plygrnd</a>

Your idea may suffer many changes over time. Don't worry, that's normal, you need to adapt and switch fast in order to stay upfront.

## Validate idea

The validation of idea is very important because we are subjective with our creations. Not all the time your idea is good. So a cold shower is benefic, and the startup idea validation is exactly that.

Talking with potential customers can be benefic from many perspectives: understand your product/service, understand if your idea is not good enough yet, the customer's needs, what they miss in the current solution.

### Where to find prospects

Everywhere can be a customer! What a generic response, right?! It is true, let's dive more in. 

#### Watch your competition audience

Basically if you don't know exactly where your customer can be found, start watching your competition, later we talk [how to analyze competition](#analyze-competition). Your competition is already in front of customers with a product or a service. But don't worry, you don't need to steal the competition's strategy, actually is not quite correct to do that, better analyze them and improve their strategy or product. 

Start looking at their website, social media, do they manage other channels like Facebook groups, discord servers, newsletter, Telegram groups, Twitter communities, etc? Because yes investigate how people interact with them.

Maybe your niche is not well defined, you don't have competition yet or you don't know where to start from. I suggest to start talking with people that you think might be your customer. It can be chaotic in the beginning but at least you talk with people.

#### Use social media

You know that social media can be a very powerful strategy? I like to talk with potential customers via Twitter, LinkedIn, even Facebook or Instagram. Is simpler because you're one step ahead against email. It's easier for them to reply there and the discussion can be more informal, doesn't have to stay in the same way as on email.

#### Email

Todo: ideas

### Who should you talk with

This is a heavy question, because usually we tend to talk with the closest people. In almost every article or book I read it was mentioned to not even thinking to talk with your family or friends. Because they can be subjective and reply based on emotional background. And somehow this is true, unless you build a product or service which targets family or friends, in that case they are your target.

Your target audience is important in the beginning and even later. But try to focus for the first time indentifying the most important customers. The one who is ready to buy imediately. Later, when the startup is well defined, you'll have marketing campaigns, sales people which will find new ways of finding new proespects and customers. Until that time you need to start from somewhere, so keep it low, keep it fast. Remember, your startup values nothing at this moment, you don't have money to spend.

So I write two paragraphs and I say nothing right to the point.

In the beginning talk with people who needs your product or service. Go there, find a way to talk with them and simply ask, they can reject you, push a bit, if they're not interested move forward. From each talk you can discover something, even the fact that they are not interested can be something to learn from: even the product is not for them, they are not the most important customer or you did something wrong, don't worry you'll learn. But start talking with them, is just that simple, just breath and send an email or DM via social media. What costs you? A rejection?! Are you going to launch a startup or you're too scared of rejection?!

If you choose an audience and discover they are not interested, maybe you did the wrong pick. Redefine the audience and go over again until you find someone interested. If no one is interested probably the idea is not good or you did something wrong.

### How many people should you talk with

3 people, because 3 is a magic number, at least in a fairy tale. How to launch a startup when you talked with 3 users? That's not exactly a validation, is more a self validation or fear of failure.

Talk with many, a lot, 3 - 5 - 10 are not enough. Talk with 100 or 1000 because you need to learn from them what are their problems. Guaranteed talking with 1000 people you can find some patterns that repeats, they have some similar issues and probably they need something specific that cannot be found at competition. Except that you break the fear and improve your communication skills.

### How to talk with prospects

Be polite, make an introduction about your subject and ask their permission to continue

Todo: continue

### Pitch the product before is built

<!-- todo: ideas -->
- try to tell them what's the idea about
- tell them when the product can be ready and what's the price
- ask what they need immediatly to sign with you
- offer discount if they buy early (50-70% lifetime or it depends), if they ask about guarantee you can tell them is like a risk for a future investment, but offer them full refund if they're not satisfied with the final product after release.
- read The mom test
- build a LP with buy now button

### Where to start from



## Build the product or service

You're good now and probably know how to launch a startup. You have the idea, is validated and need to define the product or service, but still don't know what to build or what the product should contain initially or later.

Don'y worry, go after competition and see what they offer.

## Analyze competition

How to launch a startup when you don't know what's the startup, right?! Check what others do and try to do best. But remember, some of their features are already validated by you or by them with a real audience, so you have to build them.

In order to analyze competition you can do it manually using search engines and type down advantages and disadvantages, but except this old fashion way, you should check their online presence and how to do this if now using [Tools for Analyzing Your Competition](https://whyboobo.com/startup/resources/tools-analyzing-competition/). In this article you can find a list of articles about tools and how to use them.

But you know what, is there a simpler solution?! Maybe yes for some of you, you can search on platforms or websites where [people talk and share their startups](#where-to-launch-startups). Some of your competitors can be already there, some of them build in public and you can take advantage of to learn about their main problems and improve your product.

### Check reviews of competition

Checking reviews of your competition can be a very good selling pitch for further customers. When they complains about some issues about a product, you take notes and do it in your product. Be cautious, not every feedback have to be implemented, but if many people complains about the same subject and you solve it, then you may get some new clients.

In the same time take in considereation the strong points, what the customers of your competitor mention as very good? You should have it at least at the same quality. As a customer you need to offer me more, because for me is an extra effort to change my current provider, so you need to offer me more value.

### I don't have competition

I doubt!

There are some new fields where your startup can be unique and there's no competition. But for the most of you the competition is there, just try to strive more finding them. Don't stop after the first search on google, try more keywords, use the tools below to generate keyword suggestion and try with many variations. I saw people who say how they build the mvp in 24h, maybe is possible but is not mandatory. Try to learn about the new business you start.

Enough for those who are lazy and just read this material to check it as done, but don't take action. Let's talk about those cases when you don't have competition for real. It can be harder, but not impossible. In this case you need to look around, find similarities with other startups or domains and make analogies with them. Is not 100% accurate, but it may drive you on the right road.
