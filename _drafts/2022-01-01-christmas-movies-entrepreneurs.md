## Family Man

Great movie about life and what is important more, business, family or can you have both with the right mindset. I think personalyy that every entrepreneur should watch this, because it shows that sometimes you don’t need to work that much hard and have all that money in order to have happiness in your life. Nicholas Cage did the great job in this movie.

## A Christmas Carol

Animated movie that show the true face of the Christmas spirit and how it can influence and help a person in a positive way. The message in the movie is that business can sometimes make you a bad person and can left you to live a lonely life. We always need to find the joy in everything we do, because life can pass us in a second whether you like  it or not.

## Scrooged

The message of the movie is that no matter how successful you are, it’s important to stay grounded and good person, the business will not get better if you are selfish and don’t care for your employees and people that love you.
