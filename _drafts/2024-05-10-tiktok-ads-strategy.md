Requirements:

- the video will be filmed as a selfie where me, the founder talks about the product
- it should look like a regular tiktok, not an ad. but it should interrupt the user from scrolling and stay on the video
- make a cut every 2 seconds 
- switch the shoot/cut every to seconds, like move around
- add some personality within.. at each 10-12 seconds, add a cut with some crazy sounds like like beeps or something disruptive. the sound is max 1s long
- do something strange with the sound like wispering
- tiktok says you should keep the adks short, but in fact keep them longer like 1m

The script will have 5 steps:

1. Tease a secret: start the video with something like “did you know there’s a secret way to get X in Y amount of time ”, where X = replace with your desired result and Y = the time
2. Tell a story: tell a story of the empathetic pain point that your product or service solves. And here’s an example “three years ago I started my Youtube channel. nobody watched anything. every single day I will open up Youtube Studio and I’m like Why am I putting this much work into it? I threw my phone across the room, I went to my wife and I was like this is worth it, I’m gonna have to give up on this and I almost gave up.
3. Turning point: this is the moment when you turn the previous story with the benefits of your product. in the previous example you would say something like “but then I discovered X”, where X is your product or service 
4. Teach: and teach them how to get the results with your product or service. like step 1 do this, step 2 do this and so on
5. Transition: is just the Call to action like “if you wanna see more just click below”

I felt inspired by this video, so I would like to mention it <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PymLDeKQt4g>.
