Let your restaurant, coffee shop, or sweets shop visitors scan a QR code and see your menu with their phones.

💸 You cut costs
Paper menus become unusable in a few months. Their price is higher than Customenu.

📵 No apps installed
Customenu opens in the browser.

⏰ Fast order
Are you losing customers? With a digital menu, the QR code is already on the table.

📈 Grow the business
The ease of finding the dishes makes the difference between ordering one or more products.

📲 Real-time updates
Change the dishes, and these changes are immediately visible on the customers' phones.

🌐 Multilanguage
Translate products and categories into 184 languages at no extra cost.

I've made this project open-source @ https://github.com/boobo94/customenu
